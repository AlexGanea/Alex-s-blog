<h2>ABOUT me</h2>
<h3><i>"Be the best version of yourself"</i></h3>
<p>  This is the quote I live by every day and my inspiration for my blog. Hey there, friends!
  My name is Alexandra Ganea, but everybody calls me simply Alex.
  I am 19 years old and I am currently a student at Arizona State University. <i>GO SUNDEVILS!</i>
  I am a part of Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering here at ASU, studying Computer Science
  with a focuse on software engineering. I started this blog as a personal learning project where
  I could share a little bit about me, what I like and what I'm passioned about, as well as improve
  my HTML and CSS skills.
